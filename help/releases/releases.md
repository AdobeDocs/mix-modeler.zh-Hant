# Adobe混合模組化發行版本

Adobe組合Modeler版本會在持續傳遞模式上運作，允許以可縮放、分階段的方法進行功能部署。


<!--
## Release strategy

Adobe Mix Modeler uses feature flags (also known as "toggles") to control the visibility of new features, allowing for controlled scale testing prior to full release. This release strategy includes the following phases:

* **Limited Testing**: A phased release begins with testing by internal Adobe users. It is then made available to a small group of customer accounts to ensure that the feature meets customer needs and expectations. 

* **Start of Rollout**: Rollout of a phased release begins with the Limited Testing phase. The release is then scaled from 0% to 100% availability to customers over the course of a couple months. Phased rollout happens at the Experience Cloud Organization level, so all entitled users in an organization receive the same experience.

* **General Availability (GA)**: The feature is available to 100% of entitled Experience Cloud organizations, and feature release is complete.

With each feature release, the timeline from release start to general availability may vary. The goal is to keep releases short, so that within 2 months of release start, a feature will be generally available.


## Feature flags

Feature flags are used to control the visibility of new features during release. Adobe recommends adding `app.launchdarkly.com` to your firewall's [allowed list](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/technotes/ip-addresses.html) for an optimal experience during release. Shortly after general availability is reached, the flag is removed.


## Benefits

Phased releases enable Adobe to better scale the software deployment process and ensure features are fully hardened before general availability. It also allows features to be released as soon as they are available, rather than adhering to a fixed monthly release window.

## FAQs
